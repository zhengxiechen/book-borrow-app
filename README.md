# Book Borrow App

## About

This project is a foray into designing an app to assist university students with borrowing or purchasing books from one another. There is a companion API located in [book-borrow-api](https://github.com/zhengxiechen/book-borrow-api).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn lint`

Begins linting using [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/). The rules being applied are the [airbnb configuration](https://github.com/progre/tslint-config-airbnb) with some slight modifications.


### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
